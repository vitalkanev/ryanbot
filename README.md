# ryanbot

Sorry to say, but at some point in May of 2018, someone managed to leak private information (in this
case a Discord application token). I decided to send pull request to original repository (which no longer
exists as of September 17, 2020) and, apparently, nothing happened. Developer decided to start a new repository
with the same name (I wasn't able to find my pull request where I decided to remove token), with token not
included by default. Which is good, right? ðŸ˜„

Now, the original repository [no longer exists](https://github.com/ryanshds/ryanbot], only a new "holobot" repository with completely new commit
history. So, I decided to archive this repository.

Thank you.
